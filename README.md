# 2D-Divergence-Free-Solenoidal-Filter
A 2D physics informed neural network based divergence free solenoidal filter. Takes an input 2D vector field and produces a divergence free field with the smallest changes to the vectors.

RunScript hosts an example that removes the divergence of 2D experimental data of an airfoil at 15 degrees angle of attack.
